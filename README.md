# BigDataCup2021
This is the repository for my competition entry. I used a Poisson Generalized Linear Model and K-Nearest Neighbors to show how actions after a takeaway in hockey can be modeled.

For more information, please read my paper: [Poisson GLM Takeaways](https://github.com/inm2/BigDataCup2021/blob/main/Big%20Data%20Cup%2021%20_%20Poisson%20GLM%20Takeaways.pdf)
